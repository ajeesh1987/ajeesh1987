# Hi, I'm Ajeesh  

I build digital products and AI powered experiences that ship, move metrics, and feel good to use.  

By day I work on ecommerce at scale, owning checkout and speed for millions of users.  
On the side I am building SmritiKosha, an AI first memory product that turns photos and moments into meaningful stories.

* Performance focused ecommerce journeys with faster checkout and better conversion  
* AI powered memories and storytelling with SmritiKosha
